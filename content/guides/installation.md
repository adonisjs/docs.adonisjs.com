summary: Getting started by creating and running a new AdonisJS application
---

AdonisJS is a Node.js framework and hence it requires Node.js to be installed on your computer. To be precise, we require `Node.js >= 14.15.4`, along with `npm >= 6.0.0`.

You can check the Node.js and npm versions by running the following commands.

```sh
# check node.js version
node -v

# check npm version
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed, then you can [download the binary](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system from the official website.

If you are comfortable with the command line, then we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [volta](https://volta.sh/) to install and run multiple versions of Node.js on your computer.

## Creating a new project
You can create a new project using [npm init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-init) or [yarn create](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/). Both of these tools will download the AdonisJS starter package and starts the installation process.

```sh
npm init adonis-ts-app@latest hello-world

# If using yarn
yarn create adonis-ts-app hello-world
```

The installation process prompts for the following selections.

#### Project structure
You can choose between one of the following project structures.

- `web` project structure is ideal for creating classic server rendered applications. We configure the support for sessions and also install the AdonisJS template engine.
- `api` project structure is ideal for creating an API server.
- `slim` project structure creates the smallest possible AdonisJS application and does not install any additional packages, except the framework core.

---

#### Project name
The name of the project. We define the value of this prompt inside the `package.json` file.

---

#### Configure eslint/prettier
Optionally, you can configure Eslint and prettier. Both the packages are configured with the opinionated settings used by the AdonisJS core team.

---

#### Configure webpack encore
Optionally, you can also configure [webpack encore](./http/assets-manager.md) to bundle and serve frontend dependencies.

Do note, AdonisJS is a backend framework and does not concern itself with frontend build tools. Hence the webpack setup is optional.

## Starting the development server
After creating the application, you can start the development server by running the following command.

```sh
node ace serve --watch
```

- The `serve` command starts the HTTP server and performs in-memory compilation of TypeScript to JavaScript.
- The `--watch` flag is meant to watch the file system for changes and restart the server automatically.

## Compiling for production
You must always deploy the compiled JavaScript on your production server. You can create the production build by running the following command.

```sh
node ace build --production
```

The compiled output is written to the `build` folder. You can `cd` into this folder and start the server by running the `serve.js` file directly. Learn more about the [typescript build process](./fundamentals/typescript-build-process.md)

```sh
cd build
node server.js
```
