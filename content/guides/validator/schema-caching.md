summary: A 101 guide to schema caching in AdonisJS and covering the topics around caching caveats and using refs.
---

The schema created using `schema.create` method is first complied to an executable function and then executed to validate the data against the defined rules.

The compilation process does take a couple of milliseconds before the validation begins. Based upon the performance expectations you have, you may want to consider caching the compiled schema and hence don't pay the compilation penalty on every request.

## Using the `cacheKey`
You can cache a schema by defining a unique `cacheKey`. You can generate this cache key using any approach or you can rely on the `ctx.routeKey` during an HTTP request.

```ts
await request.validate({
  schema: schema.create({...}),
  cacheKey: ctx.routeKey,
})
```

- The first call to `request.validate` will compile the schema and saves the output in reference to the `cacheKey`.
- Until the `cacheKey` is same, the schema won't be compiled again.

## Caching caveats
Caching in any form is not free and same is the case with the schema caching. If your schema relies on runtime values, then caching schema will not give desired outcome. Consider the following example:

- You are creating a form that accepts the user **state** and their **city**.
- The city options are based upon the value of the selected **state**.

```ts
/**
 * Assuming following variables holds data
 */
const STATES = []
const CITIES = {}

export default class AddressValidator {
  public selectedState = this.ctx.request.input('state') // ðŸ‘ˆ

  public schema = schema.create({
    state: schema.enum(STATES),
    city: schema.enum(CITIES[this.selectedState] || [])
  })
}
```

If you look at the above example, the enum options for the `city` are dependent on the `selectedState` and may vary with every HTTP request. As per the caching rules, the enum options after the first request will get cached and will not change as the user will change the state selection.

### Available options
Following are some of the available options to encounter the caching caveats.

---

#### Give up caching
The first option is to give up caching. This will add a delay of couple of milliseconds to your requests, but gives you the simplest API to use to runtime values within your schema definition.

---

#### Create a unique key
Considering the above example, you can append the selected state to the `cacheKey` and hence each state will have its own copy of cached schema. For example:

```ts
export default class AddressValidator {
  public selectedState = this.ctx.request.input('state')

  public schema = schema.create({
    state: schema.enum(STATES),
    city: schema.enum(CITIES[this.selectedState] || [])
  })

  // highlight-start
  public cacheKey = `${this.ctx.routeKey}-${selectedState}`
  // highlight-end
}
```

The above approach has its own set of downsides. If there are 37 states, then there will be 37 cached copies of the same schema with a small variation. Also, this number will grow exponentially if you need more than one dynamic value.

In fact, giving up caching is better than caching too many schemas with small variations.

---

#### Using refs
Refs gives you the best of the both worlds. You can still cache your schema and also reference the runtime values inside them. Following is an example of the same:

```ts
export default class AddressValidator {
  public selectedState = this.ctx.request.input('state')

  public refs = schema.refs({
    cities: CITIES[this.selectedState] || []
  })

  public schema = schema.create({
    state: schema.enum(STATES),
    city: schema.enum(this.refs.cities)
  })
}
```

Instead of referencing `CITIES[this.selectedState]` directly, you move it to the `schema.refs` object and from there on, the cities will be picked up at runtime without re-compiling the schema.

:::note

Refs only work if the **validation rule** or the **schema type** supports them.
